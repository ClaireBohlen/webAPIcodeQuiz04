Hey Lio,

Thanks for taking a look at my code. I'm struggling with my checkAnwser function. I can't find the code to create the value for the variable userAnwser and how to compare that value with the correct answer. 
function checkAnwser (){
        console.log ("Great")
        var userAnwser = e.target.textContent;
        if (runningQuestionIdx.correct===userAnwser)
